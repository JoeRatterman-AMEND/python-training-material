    "## Install Python\n",
    "Python is an open source programming tool that has become one of the most popular in the world due to its versatility & ease of use. To download python, navigate to https://www.python.org/downloads/ & select the version appropriate for your machine. As with most programs, there will be prompts that ask if any custom settings are needed - selecting the defaults are fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have downloaded & installed python. Now the fun part - how to use python. Python has a number of IDE (Integrated Development Environment) options. If this is a new term, think \"user-interface\". A few options are listed below - some are easier to get setup than others. In my opinion, whatever you can figure out to install & use is the best choice. \n",

    "Installing JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebooks is very straightforward & is great for making Markdown files. So I'll run through that example. To install on Windows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type Command Prompt into your 'Start Menu'. \n",
    "2. Type \"py\" - this starts python. \n",
    "3. Type \"pip install jupyterlab\"\n",
    "4. A few questions may pop up, type 'yes' as needed.\n",
    "5. After installation, open up your 'Start Menu' again & search for JupyterLab. \n",
    "6. The user-interface will launch & you'll be able to create python scripts from scratch. "

    "\n",
    "### Loading Packages\n",
    "A package is a collection of functions that someone or some organization made to simplify frequently used processes. For example, if I'm frequently having to calculate the square root of a number and add 5 & am tired of manually typing the steps every time, I can write a function to simplify the process: \n",
    "\n",
    "def sq_root(num int): <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   sqrt(num) + 5\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now consider I have to do the same process 1000 times with 1000 different numbers. Rather than type it out 1000 times, I can make 1000 functions (or one more complex function) and then package them, so I don't have to recreate them. This is a simple example, but the idea stands - a package is a grouping of functions that can be imported to your working session. \n",
    "\n",
    "To import a function use the syntax import (package) as (alias). Replace (package) with the actual name of the package and (alias) with an abbreviation. Aliases are optional but convenient as they can reference packages with fewer keystrokes. More on that later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many common packages are already installed when you download python, however, some packages do need to be installed. This can be directly completed in a python script or it can be completed using the command prompt. Packages only need to be installed once, so it is best practice to remove package installations from your scripts."
