    "# Data Manipulation in Python\n",
    "Whether you want to be a data scientist, data engineer, or just automate some boring tasks with python, you'll spend a large portion of of your time manipulating data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data manipulation can take many forms, but in essence it is converting data from one format to another. Think about getting a monthly report of sales numbers from your boss. Your company is global, but you're tasked with finding the sales rep with the most sales in North America. What steps do you need to do to find this information? Maybe something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filter the file for the North America Region\n",
    "2. Add a look-up of distinct sales reps\n",
    "3. Add a sumif to determine the total sales by sales rep\n",
    "4. Sort the total sales from highest to lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these steps are manipulating the raw data to get the final answer. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 03 showed how to load a csv file into python. When the data is loaded in using pandas, it is loaded into a special data structure - a dataframe. A data frame is a table structure made up of rows and columns. Much like an excel table, a column typically represents an attribute or variable while a row represents a record: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rep ID | Rep Name | Month | Sales (units)|\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | \n",
    "| 1aa | Joe | January | 100 |\n",
    "| 1aa | Joe | February | 200 |\n",
    "| 1bb | John | January | 150 |\n",
    "| 1bb | John | February | 150 |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this table, we have 4 records & 4 columns describing each record. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a very popular package, so there is great documentation online & plenty of questions posted on Stack Overflow. There are other data structures that can store data in a similar way - dictionary, matrix, parquet, other. Choosing one is dependent on your programs needs. In general, a pandas dataframe is a good place to start. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover these common data manipulation action: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Select / Drop\n",
    "- Filter\n",
    "- Distinct\n",
    "- Order By\n",
    "- Mutate\n",
    "- Group By & Summarize\n",
    "- Merge\n",
    "- Append / Union\n",
