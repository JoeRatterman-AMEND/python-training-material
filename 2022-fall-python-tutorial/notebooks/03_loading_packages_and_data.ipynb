    "# Loading Packages in Python\n",

    "### What is a package\n",
    "A **package** is a collection of functions that someone or some organization has created & published. There is a package repository called PyPi that is commonly used to publish packages for anyone to use. Additionally, packages can be published & downloaded from GitHub or other Git repositories. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To import an entire package use the below syntax: <br>\n",
    "- import math <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To import a specific function from a package use the below syntax: <br>\n",
    "- from math import sqrt <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If only one or two functions will be used from a package (some packages could have 100s of functions), it is best practice to use the from *package* import *function*. This can avoid dependency issues where different packages may have functions with the same name. Additionally, it makes the code easier to read, as the reader will know exactly what function comes from each package. Typically this won't be an issue, so use your best judgement. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a function \n",
    "A **function** is a collection of processes designed to complete a specific process. For example, if I'm frequently having to calculate the square root of a number and add 5 & am tired of manually typing the steps every time, I can write a function to simplify the process. More details on functions will be given in a later section. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final note - Aliases\n",
    "When importing a package, it is common practice to provide the package name with an alias: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python requires this syntax **package_name**.*function* to use a function from a specific package. The alias helps keep the code clean & easy to read. Typically, packages with short names do not use aliases: <br>\n",
    "- import numpy as np<br>\n",
    "- import math<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the *package* import *function* format, python does not require **package_name**.*function* to run a function. See the example below: "
