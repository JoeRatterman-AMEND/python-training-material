    "## What is Python\n",
    "Python is an open source programming language that has become one of the most popular in the world due to its versatility & ease of use. Let's break that down one-step further: \n",
    "\n",
    "a. Open Source = free to use<br>\n",
    "b. Programming Language = computer language that converts human logic to computer logic<br>\n",
    "c. Versatility = python can build websites, machine learning models, connections between various systems, and more!<br>\n",
    "d. Ease of Use = *relatively* straightforward to read & understand logic - this one will be hard to prove, but we'll do our best!<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use Python\n",
    "Run python using.... \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Command Line<br>\n",
    "2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ok... what is an IDE**? <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A tool that allows a programmer to load multiple tools, programs, scripts into one area to develop in a given program language. Popular examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visual Studio Code - supports hundreds of different programming languages<br>\n",
    "2. Jupyter Lab - supports hundreds of different programming languages<br>\n",
    "3. R Studio - primarily supports R code<br>\n",
    "4. Hundreds of other IDEs exist - the best one is the one that YOU like the most.<br>\n",
