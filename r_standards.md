# Introduction
This document serves to provide coding conventions for R.

This document draws consolidates information from various other published style guides. Primarily the Tidyverse Style Guide (https://style.tidyverse.org/) & Hadley Wickham's Style Guide (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html). This is intended to be a living document that can be updated as additional functionality / features become available in R.

This is to serve as a **guideline**. Do not waste excess time to conform to standards but do your best to use them as described in this document from the begining of a project.
